Development Log

01/04/19: Added all the files described in the prototype. Sudoku abstract class along with StandardSudoku and CustomSudoku which both 
extends Sudoku. Constructors and abstract class were added for each subclass but not implemented. An empty Driver class has also been added.

01/05/19:

01/06/19: Add method and Mistake method updated in Driver file. I also added an ArrayList to keep track of the mistakes in Sudoku. I also added the remove method which removes a number from the puzzle.

01/07/19: InputNums in StandardSudoku implemented, but only works on even dimensions. Driver is updated to test both CustomSudoku and StandardSudoku. Small mistakes in all the files corrected and toString method changed to PrintPuzzle.

01/08/19: Write InputNums for CustomSudoku. I also wrote code in Driver to test PrintPuzzle and InputNums method of both StandardSudoku and CustomSudoku. InputNums for StandardSudoku needs to be fixed and more helper methods and private field added.
